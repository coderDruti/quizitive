          Inquizitive, being a quiz app, executes the Testing effect (as
          aforesaid) by letting educators and students create quizes to
          strengthen their memory.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p className="para3">
        The quizes can be created on various concepts and topics and of varying
        difficulty levels to practice desirable difficulty as stated in the
        following study: According to the retrieval effort hypothesis, difficult
        but successful retrievals are better for memory than easier successful
        retrievals which supports the idea of finding a desirable difficulty
        within the retrieval practice considering our memory biases.

        Quizing oneself repeatedly (a.k.a spaced repetion) guarantees that the
        concepts will be embedded in the long-term memory for <i>long</i> indeed
