          The testing effect (also known as retrieval practice, active recall,
          practice testing, or test-enhanced learning) suggests long-term memory
          is increased when part of the learning period is devoted to retrieving
          information from memory.

          Inquizitive, being a quiz app, executes the Testing effect (as
          aforesaid) by letting educators and students create quizes to
          strengthen their memory.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        The quizes can be created on various concepts and topics and of varying
        difficulty levels to practice desirable difficulty as stated in the
        following study: According to the retrieval effort hypothesis, difficult
        but successful retrievals are better for memory than easier successful
        retrievals which supports the idea of finding a desirable difficulty
        within the retrieval practice considering our memory biases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quizing oneself repeatedly (a.k.a spaced repetion) guarantees that the
        concepts will be embedded in the long-term memory for <i>long</i> indeed
      </p>
      <p>
        So create quizes and be Inquizitive with our amazing software!! <br />
        <strong>Happy learning!!</strong>
